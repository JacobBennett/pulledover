                        <p>Details coming soon on how to donate. For now, just message me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/stauffermatt">@stauffermatt</a> and we can figure out how.</p>
                        <h3>Why Donate?</h3>
                        <p>Because Twilio, the service that sends the texts and records your voice, costs money. As does hosting, and as did the design I paid to get done for this site. And right now that money is coming out of my bank account. If PulledOver survives, it will require some financial assistance.</p>
