# Contributing to Pulled Over

Thanks for considering a contribution!

- Fork and Pull Request
- Make sure Pull Request descriptions show as much as possible of the purpose behind your Pull Request; considering an animated GIF for clarity (use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) if you don't have a GIF recorder)
- PHP should follow PSR-2 and load with PSR-4
- CSS should use shallow selectors and alphabetized properties
- If [Nitpick](https://nitpick-ci.com/) tells you to make a change, please make it and update your PR. However, please feel free to ignore any Nitpick comments that are clearly a misconfiguration--for example, all tests and migrations will show errors about being in a top-level namespace, but that's actually completely fine.
